# BaliJS Talks
Talk proposals and discussion

We're trying something different and using GitHub Issues for talk submissions. This way people can ask questions, give feedback and +1 their favourites. If your talk isn't scheduled for the next meetup, leave the issue open and we may invite you to give it in the future (based on theme or time constraints)

After each meetup, we (or the speaker) will update issues with slides, links, and other useful information.

# Things to think about

Have a read through [this slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/LookAtMySlides/codeware). It's a very good overview of how to design a good slidedeck for a technical presentation.

## Slides

* Use very large fonts and less text per screen so your slide is legible at the back of the room

* If you have code examples, we suggest you make them take up the entire screen with as large a font as possible

* Minimise the use of code examples and bullet points as they will be hard to read

* If you want to demo something, consider using a screen capture movie or gif. [licecap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap) is a tool that can help with this.

## Livecoding

There should be an internet connection at the place of our meetups, but sometimes the connection is not really stable. So we suggest that you download library,framework,npm package,etc before your talks sessions start.
